	abstract = {La crisis climática que enfrenta el planeta no cuenta con precedentes, y esta se encrudece con
el paso del tiempo. Al Sur del mundo, en Chile no ha sido la excepción a los impactos
negativos del cambio climático, es más, en los últimos años la población se ha visto envuelta
en diversos eventos hidrometeorológicos de gran envergadura, que, han causado tanto
pérdidas humanas, como materiales. Dentro de estos eventos, los de mayor daño y
recurrencia han sido las inundaciones, las que han dejado lecciones para levantar mejoras en
las políticas públicas en torno a la gestión de riesgos por desastres.
Algunas de las claves para hacer frente a estos fenómenos socio-naturales radican tanto en la
cooperación intersectorial, como en el trabajo multinstitucional, cumpliendo un rol
fundamental la coordinación de las autoridades tanto locales como centrales para lograr la
convocatoria de los diversos frentes; sin embargo, la carencia de unificación de la
información y/o metodologías que permitan realizar de forma eficaz el levantamiento de
recursos necesarios para la prevención de las emergencias, tales son la compilación de datos
históricos de desastres e instrumentos como mapas de inundación.
El cambio climático y en consecuencia el aumento de las precipitaciones, variaciones de la
isoterma, ríos atmosféricos, entre otros eventos, son los causantes de que en el mundo haya
tanta mortandad, afectando a gran parte de la población, es por ello que se hace indiscutible
la necesidad de contar con mayores herramientas que nos permitan mitigar los efectos
negativos que pueda ocasionar el aumento de las precipitaciones.
En la Región de La Araucanía se encuentra el río Cautín, de gran importancia cultural y
económica, en su ribera se han asentado diversas ciudades, tales como, Curacautín, Victoria,
Lautaro, Vilcún, Padre de Las Casas y la capital regional, Temuco. En la historia reciente ha
sufrido desbordes que han causado inundaciones a las poblaciones aledañas, generando daños
significativos, por lo que se hace necesario fortalecer la política de mitigación de los daños
por los latentes riesgos de inundación en la ribera del río, dando un enfoque multiinstitucional
con colaboración tanto pública como privada, para un mejor Ordenamiento del territorio},

	abstract = {Operational flood forecasting in Canada is a provincial responsibility that is carried out by several entities across the country. However, the increasing costs and impacts of floods require better and nationally coordinated flood prediction systems. A more coherent flood forecasting framework for Canada can enable implementing advanced prediction capabilities across the different entities with responsibility for flood forecasting. Recently, the Canadian meteorological and hydrological services were tasked to develop a national flow guidance system. Alongside this initiative, the Global Water Futures program has been advancing cold regions process understanding, hydrological modeling, and forecasting. A community of practice was established for industry, academia, and decision-makers to share viewpoints on hydrological challenges. Taken together, these initiatives are paving the way towards a national flood forecasting framework. In this article, forecasting challenges are identified (with a focus on cold regions), and recommendations are made to promote the creation of this framework. These include the need for cooperation, well-defined governance, and better knowledge mobilization. Opportunities and challenges posed by the increasing data availability globally are also highlighted. Advances in each of these areas are positioning Canada as a major contributor to the international operational flood forecasting landscape. This article highlights a route towards the deployment of capacities across large geographical domains.},

	abstract = {The future increase of large-scale weather disasters resulting from the increased frequency of extreme weather events caused by climate change is a matter of concern. Predicting future flood damage through statistical analysis requires accurate modeling of the relationship between historical precipitation and flood damage. An analysis that considers precipitation as a time series may be appropriate for this purpose. Functional data analysis was applied to model the relationship between historical daily precipitation and daily flood damage for river basins in the Kanto and Koshin regions of Japan. Flood damage statistics from the national government and 1-km grid past precipitation data from the National Agriculture and Food Research Organization were used. The models obtained through the functional data analysis were more accurate than those derived from the simple linear regression without considering the time series of precipitation. The new models were also about four times more accurate in estimating the annual sum of flood damage, compared to the flood damage of each flood event. The accuracy of prediction was higher in recent years than in earlier years of the study period (1993–2020). The results showed that the influence of precipitation on flood damage was more apparent in recent years. This findings may imply that the progress of the river development project and the resulting improvement of the structures along the river have indirectly affected levels of flood damage associated with levels of precipitation.},

	abstract = {As the adverse impacts of hydrological extremes increase in many regions of the world, a better understanding of the drivers of changes in risk and impacts is essential for effective flood and drought risk management and climate adaptation. However, there is currently a lack of comprehensive, empirical data about the processes, interactions, and feedbacks in complex human–water systems leading to flood and drought impacts. Here we present a benchmark dataset containing socio-hydrological data of paired events, i.e. two floods or two droughts that occurred in the same area. The 45 paired events occurred in 42 different study areas and cover a wide range of socio-economic and hydro-climatic conditions. The dataset is unique in covering both floods and droughts, in the number of cases assessed and in the quantity of socio-hydrological data. The benchmark dataset comprises (1) detailed review-style reports about the events and key processes between the two events of a pair; (2) the key data table containing variables that assess the indicators which characterize management shortcomings, hazard, exposure, vulnerability, and impacts of all events; and (3) a table of the indicators of change that indicate the differences between the first and second event of a pair. The advantages of the dataset are that it enables comparative analyses across all the paired events based on the indicators of change and allows for detailed context- and location-specific assessments based on the extensive data and reports of the individual study areas. The dataset can be used by the scientific community for exploratory data analyses, e.g. focused on causal links between risk management; changes in hazard, exposure and vulnerability; and flood or drought impacts. The data can also be used for the development, calibration, and validation of socio-hydrological models. The dataset is available to the public through the GFZ Data Services (Kreibich et al., 2023, https://doi.org/10.5880/GFZ.4.4.2023.001).},

	abstract = {A major source of uncertainty in flood statistics are the different flood generation processes. These make the assumption of homogeneous samples questionable. To overcome this issue, a framework for assessing the influence of catchment and climate attributes on flood-generating processes and their effect on flood statistics has been developed and applied to 252 catchments in New Zealand. Mean daily discharge data time series with a length ranging from 20 to 81 years were used. Flood events were classified according to their hydrograph shape. Three types were considered based on the different forcing: heavy rainfall of short duration (termed R1), moderate rainfall of medium intensity and duration (R2), and long-duration rainfall sequences of usually larger spatial extent (R3). The dominant flood type in each catchment was then linked to catchment and climate attributes. This allowed to identify the impact of each flood type on flood statistics and how the flood types have changed over time. The main drivers determining the flood type were rainfall variability and antecedent conditions. Small and steep catchments were dominated by heavy-rainfall floods of shorter duration, while flat and wet catchments were dominated by long-duration floods with larger volumes. Such information can support selection of effective flood protection and management measures.},

	abstract = {In consideration of ongoing climate changes, it has been necessary to provide new tools capable of mitigating hydrogeological risks. These effects will be more marked in small catchments, where the geological and environmental contexts do not require long warning times to implement risk mitigation measures. In this context, deep learning models can be an effective tool for local authorities to have solid forecasts of outflows and to make correct choices during the alarm phase. In this study, we investigate the use of deep learning models able to forecast hydrometric height in very fast hydrographic basins. The errors of the models are very small and about a few centimetres, with several forecasting hours. The models allow a prediction of extreme events with also 4–6 h (RMSE of about 10–30 cm, with a forecasting time of 6 h) in hydrographic basins characterized by rapid changes in the river flow rates. However, to reduce the uncertainties of the predictions with the increase in forecasting time, the system performs better when using a machine learning model able to provide a confidence interval of the prediction based on the last observed river flow rate. By testing models based on different input datasets, the results indicate that a combination of models can provide a set of predictions allowing for a more comprehensive description of the possible future evolutions of river flows. Once the deep learning models have been trained, their application is purely objective and very rapid, permitting the development of simple software that can be used even by lower skilled individuals.},

However, in China with diverse geography and complex climate types, a systematic evaluation of different modeling schemes for large-sample hydrological datasets is still lacking. This study preliminarily constructed a dataset of catchment attributes and meteorology covering 544 basins in China, and systematically evaluated the applicability of process-based models (PBMs), long short-term memory (LSTM) models, and hybrid modeling methods. The results demonstrated: (1) The accuracy of meteorological data critically impacts the prediction performance of hydrological models. High-quality precipitation data enables the model to better simulate the runoff generation process in the basin, thereby improving prediction accuracy. (2) The hybrid modeling method possesses regional modeling capabilities comparable to those of LSTM model. It also demonstrates strong generalization capabilities. In predicting ungauged basins, the hybrid model exhibits greater stability than the LSTM model. (3) Among the two hybrid modeling methods, the differentiable hybrid modeling scheme offers a deeper understanding and simulation of hydrological processes, along with the ability to output unobserved intermediate hydrological variables, compared to the alternative hybrid modeling schemes. Its prediction results are more consistent with the water balance of the basin. The research results provide a systematic analysis for evaluating the applicability of different hydrological modeling methods in 544 basins in China, offering important guidance for the selection and optimization of future hydrological models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) is commonly used as a model evaluation metric in hydrology, but its prominence is often taken for granted. This study explores the social factors behind its adoption. Introduced in 1970, the NSE gained traction as computational advancements spurred the growth of hydrological models and evaluation metrics. This, in turn, led to the need to converge on broadly accepted metrics. In 1990, a committee recommended the NSE alongside two other metrics. One of the main developers of SWAT, a widely used hydrological model, adopted only the NSE part of this recommendation, solidifying the NSE’s dominance. This storyline shows that the NSE’s primacy appears to be derived more from tradition than from any demonstration of technical superiority. To date, path dependence is visible in on-going research efforts resulting from the popularity of the NSE. This historical perspective highlights how social processes have shaped the way hydrological models are evaluated.},
