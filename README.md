Data, scripts and documents used for my final project "Use of machine learning models for flow prediction in the Cautín River using R", which consists on the evaluation of the accuracy of gradient boosting, random forest, and LSTM models for the runoff at the "Río Cautín en Cajón" gauge, based on information from gauges upstream and precipitations.
