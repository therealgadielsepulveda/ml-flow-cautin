# What is this about?
Data, scripts and documents used for "Use of machine learning models for flow prediction in the Cautín River using R", my final project at the Applied Programming (IIO222), Fall 2025 course at Universidad de La Frontera ([UFRO](https://www.ufro.cl)). This projects consists on the evaluation of the accuracy of gradient boosting, random forest, and LSTM models for the runoff at the "Río Cautín en Cajón" gauge, based on information from gauges upstream and precipitations.

# Testing
## Requirements
At the moment of publishing, the full project can be reproduced on any computer with R (4.5.0) and Python (3.11 or later) installed.
It is strongly recommended to have RStudio installed. On any case, you will need at least 5 GB of free space on your drive.

## Settings
1. Download the full source code on your local computer.
2. Run the "master.R" script. This script calls all other scripts, allowing the user to follow the complete process.

**WORK IN PROGRESS**
